## Introduction

This project is open source under the MIT license and uses TypeScript as the primary programming language. We encourage contributions from the community. This guide will walk you through the process of contributing code, reporting bugs (tracked on our Redmine instance at [https://redmine.mariosm.xyz/projects/sgl](https://redmine.mariosm.xyz/projects/sgl)), and improving documentation.

## Ways to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to the project, beyond just writing code. Here are a few ideas:

* **Fix bugs:** If you find a bug, please report it on our Redmine bug tracker: [https://redmine.mariosm.xyz/projects/sgl](https://redmine.mariosm.xyz/projects/sgl).
* **Improve documentation:** The project documentation is always a work in progress. If you find any documentation that is unclear, outdated, or missing, please submit a pull request to improve it.
* **Write code:** We welcome contributions of new features and bug fixes. 
* **Test the project:** Help us ensure the quality of the project by testing it and reporting any issues you find.

## Finding an Issue

If you're interested in contributing code, a good place to start is by looking at the open issues on our Redmine bug tracker: [https://redmine.mariosm.xyz/projects/sgl](https://redmine.mariosm.xyz/projects/sgl).  Look for issues labeled "bug" or "help wanted" that you feel comfortable tackling.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before you can contribute code, you'll need to set up your development environment. You'll need Node.js, pnpm, a PostgreSQL server, a Slack workspace, and access to 2 Slack applications.  Specific instructions for setting up the environment can be found in the project's README.md file.

## Creating a Pull Request

Once you've made changes to the code, you'll need to create a pull request to submit your changes for review.  A pull request lets you share your proposed changes with the project maintainers and get feedback before they are merged into the main codebase.

Here's a general workflow for creating a pull request:

1. Fork the project repository on Github.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine.
3. Make your changes to the code.
4. Commit your changes locally.
5. Push your changes to your fork on Github.
6. Create a pull request from your fork to the main branch of the upstream repository.
7. Address any feedback from reviewers and make additional changes as needed.

## Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting your pull request, make sure to:

*  Ensure your code follows the project's coding style and formatting guidelines as defined in the `.prettierrc` file.
*  Write clear and concise commit messages that describe your changes.
*  Add unit tests for any new code you write.
*  Run the project's test suite and make sure all tests pass.

## Code Style and Formatting

We use the `.prettierrc` file to enforce consistent coding style and formatting across the codebase. Please make sure your code adheres to the guidelines outlined in this file.

## Signing Your Commits

Please sign your commits using your full name and email address. This can usually be done by configuring your Git client.
